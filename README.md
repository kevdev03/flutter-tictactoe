# Flutter - TicTacToe

## What this project is
This is a post-tutorial app using Flutter, Google's newest framework using the Dart Language.

## What is Flutter?
Flutter, as mentioned above, is a framework using the Dart Language. It's a reactive framework that caters to app development. What's neat here is that you only need to maintain *one codebase* for iOS and Android applications. You can, however, write OS-exclusive code, but that's for another repo.

## What does this project do?
I based this app from the React tutorials located at their [tutorials page](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

###Limitations
There are, however, limitations. I'm currently working on these features:

* Determining the winner
* Displaying the move history
* And possibly travelling back to that move.

Thanks for reading!
